# Hello World API

## Details

A simple "Hello World" API. Meaning:

1. It should be a RESTful JSON API that listens on a port of your choice.

2. When someone sends an HTTP request to the route /hello, you should return a welcome message, in JSON format. This message can be anything you want. 

## Run the API

- Run the command ```$> node index.js ``` to start the API on port 9000.
- Send a ```post``` request to ```localhost:9000/``` to see the JSON message.
